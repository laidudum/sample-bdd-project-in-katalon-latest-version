# Katalon Studio (v9 and v10) with BDD - Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate setup for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing in Katalon Studio, compatible with both versions 9 and 10. It provides a structured template designed to streamline the development and execution of BDD tests using Gherkin syntax. With this boilerplate, users can write human-readable scenarios that align with business requirements and convert them directly into automated test cases.
